Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. Mmmm… what's that m'boy? You cannot rewrite history! Not one line! You were expecting someone else? Renewed? Have I? That's it, I've been renewed. It's part of the TARDIS. Without it I couldn't survive. I don't want to go. But there are three rules! One: I'm in charge. Two: I'm not 'the Professor', I'm the Doctor! And the third... Well, I'll think up the third by the time we get back to Perivale.

This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? Alright? Of course I'm alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs. We all have a universe of our own terrors to face. Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments not water pistols! I'm a Doctor… though probably not the one that you were expecting

Obviously the Time Lords have programmed the TARDIS always to return to Earth. It seems that I am some kind of a galactic yo-yo! We're trying to defeat the Daleks, not start a jumble sale! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. You cannot rewrite history! Not one line! Don't worry, Brigadier. People will be shooting at you soon. I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there.
